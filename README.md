# WebXR Layers Sample
<!-- 
[Documentation](https://github.com/und3fined-v01d/webxr-layers/tree/docs) | [Application](https://webxr-layers.netlify.app) -->

This repository is an amalgamation of WebXR samples created using the [WebXR API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxrlayers-1/#intro), with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) as the primary 3D rendering library as part of the [MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/).

## Getting Started
- [Project Setup - Local Machine ](./docs/Project-Setup.md) : Since WebXR only works over secure HTTPS connections, we would require a few initial configurations such as an OpenSSL certificate to get the project up and running on the local machime

- [Project Setup - Oculus Browser](./docs/Oculus-Dev-Setup.md): Detailed steps leading upto a complete developer and debugging setup within the Oculus Browser

## Samples Overview
This application contains samples that belong to two broad categories:

- [Creaing and Interacting with Video Layers in an XR Environment]()
- Hand Gestures and Interactions with Three.js Objects
